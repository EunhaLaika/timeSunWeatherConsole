It provides time, sun altitude, temperature and weather information.

Time info depends on your system's time.

If you click GPS button, it will automatically find your location and will provide your location's sun altitude, temperature and weather info.

You can manually input city's name in english and press enter key(in mobile environment, return key), then it will provide the city's sun altitude, temperature and weather info.

Sun altitude, temperature and weather info will be updated every 10 minutes.
